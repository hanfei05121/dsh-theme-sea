# Open Sea static Harness installer

This path is for users who run a prebuilt Harness and do not want to compile a
client plugin. The installer copies this directory to the frontend as
`open-sea-skin/` and inserts one marked deferred script before `</head>`.

Stop Harness before install, update, or uninstall. When the command finishes,
start Harness again (`dsh web` for CLI users), keep that process running, and
then reload the browser. A stopped server can leave an already-open browser on
the **Failed to load plugins** screen even though the frontend files are valid.

From any directory, use the GitHub bootstrap:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hanfei05121/dsh-theme-sea/main/install.sh | bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hanfei05121/dsh-theme-sea/main/install.sh | bash -s -- --update
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hanfei05121/dsh-theme-sea/main/install.sh | bash -s -- --uninstall
```

If you already cloned the repository, first enter its root and then run the
local script:

```sh
cd open-sea-skin
bash native-dist/install-skin.sh
```

Use `--dry-run` to inspect matched installations and `--dist PATH` (or the
`DSH_DIST` environment variable) to select one exact frontend build.

Detection checks npx caches, common global npm packages, a sibling Harness
source build, and the current working directory's `apps/web/dist`. Installation
and update first remove only an existing Open Sea marker, then preserve the
current index as `index.html.oss-backup`. Uninstall removes only the current
marker and `open-sea-skin/`; it intentionally does not restore an old index over
a newer Harness build.

Re-run `--update` after every Harness upgrade because an upgrade can replace the
frontend `index.html` and assets. All settings are stored in the Harness origin's
localStorage (`ossEnabled`, `ossSea`, `ossTime`, `ossGlass`, `ossAutoCycle`).
