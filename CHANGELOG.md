# Changelog

All notable changes to Open Sea Skin are documented here.

## 1.2.4 — 2026-09-09

### Fixed

- Quick controls follow asynchronous Harness document-language changes in both
  Chinese and English, including accessibility labels, without losing focus or
  control state. The observer is removed on disposal. Thanks to @Max-Null for
  reporting the issue in #6; the fix lives in the shared source and all generated
  install targets.

### Documentation

- Recommend the prebuilt npm package to avoid Git transport failures during
  installation; explain why a `git ls-remote` error is not proof of a blocked
  build script (#8).

## 1.2.3 — 2026-09-07

### Fixed

- DSH Desktop advanced and extended layouts now paint a single shared glass
  background. The sidebar, conversation and details panes no longer differ
  in opacity due to transparent sidebar overrides and stacked conversation fills.
- Composer cards and dialogs retain their own backgrounds. Disabling or
  unloading Open Sea restores the desktop's original styles.

### Tested

- Desktop shell regression based on DSH Desktop Beta `2.0.5-beta.1`: 24
  combinations of layout, native material, light/dark mode and glass opacity,
  plus settings, text input, disable/re-enable and disposal in Chromium.
- The old `1.2.2` bundle fails this regression: at 40% glass the sidebar's
  effective opacity is 0%, while nested conversation fills reach 64%.

## 1.2.2 — 2026-09-01

### Added

- Quick-controls panel gains an enable toggle, an automatic day-cycle toggle,
  and a reset-to-defaults button. Disabling the skin now only tears down the
  ocean surface while keeping the button and panel, so the skin can always be
  re-enabled from the same page.
- Public npm publishing metadata and guarded release automation for DSH
  Desktop managed installation.

### Fixed

- Dragging the daylight slider now unchecks the automatic day-cycle toggle to
  match the persisted state.
- Native source integration now supports Harness `0.1.2-alpha.3` and its split
  client store, renderer, and session services.
- Browsers without WebGPU can use a capped low-end WebGL2 fallback instead of
  stopping at an unavailable screen.

## 1.2.1 — 2026-08-18

### Changed

- The Chrome/Edge extension is now Harness-only and no longer replaces the
  browser new-tab page.
- Loopback pages must match the DeepSeek Harness title, root element, and
  server-injected boot marker before the extension changes their DOM.
- Browser acceptance now proves that real Harness pages are skinned while a
  generic localhost app and an existing third-party new-tab homepage remain
  untouched.

## 1.2.0 — 2026-08-17

### Added

- A root `dsh.bundle` package that installs directly into DeepSeek Harness.
- Lower-left quick controls for wave size, daylight, glass opacity, and the
  automatic day/night cycle in the one-line DSH installation.
- A DeepSeek Harness-specific marketplace cover and four 40%-glass gallery
  animations covering dark mode, light mode, waves, and sunset.
- Host-route boundary tests for local renderer assets.

### Fixed

- Kept the native Settings dialog above the conversation composer at wide
  aspect ratios.
- Restored the lower-left Skin settings launcher and persisted every control.

## 1.1.0 — 2026-08-17

- Added the native Harness source integration, static installer, browser
  acceptance coverage, and bilingual 40%-glass gallery.

## 1.0.0 — 2026-08-14

- Initial Open Sea WebGPU showcase and Chrome/Edge extension.
